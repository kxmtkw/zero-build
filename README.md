# Zero - Super Easy Build System

**Zero** is a C/C++ build system designed to be as **easy** as possible to use, without lacking any features. Written in python!

**Zero** is a build system, not a meta build system. It handles dependency resolution to compilation and linking by itself.

Read more about the architecture here: [Architecture](docs/01-arch.md)

## Usage

First, create a `zerobuild.py` file in your project root and import **zero**.

```python
from zero import **
```

Create a **Build** object named **build**.

```python
build = Build()
```

Configure the **build** object by specifying the compiler and the build directory.

```python
build.compiler = "gcc"
build.directory = "build" # or Path("build") also works!
```

To create an executable, create an **Executable** object! Specify the sources an arguments!

```python
main = Executable()
main.source = Source(
	"src/main.c",
	"src/utils.c" # or Path("src") / "utils.c" also works!
)
main.arguments = Flags.Wall, Flags.O3
```

And you are done! Yes that's all.
Run the **zero** cli tool to make your executable.
```bash
zero make
```
A binary named **main** can now be found at **build/bin/main**

Read more about how to use and configure Zero here: [Configuration & Usage](docs/03-configuration.md).


## Installation

**Zero** is still in its infant stage, but you can install it through any pypi package manager. The package name is `zero-build`.
```bash
pip install zero-build
```
> [!WARNING]
> For Linux, You might have to use **--break-system-packages**. This is a workaround for now until I make packages for major Linux distributions.
